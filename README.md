# reactRank 
 A Vite React App by Kenneth Koh
## For General Assembly SEI-49
Wanted to brag and share your favourite videogames? Wanted to present those favourite games in a really cool looking list?
Want a list you could look back and realized how much you changed/didn't change?

<sup>This was something I wanted to do for a long time, though now I understand why so few people made one (it's extremely hard!)</sup>

## How to Use
![Sequence 01_1](https://github.com/kkyz13/reactRank/assets/155720573/a3a83c1f-3723-4d83-8884-d602751ad4ed)

After searching for your video game, you can click the "add to current list" button accompanying the search result to add it to your list.

![Sequence 01](https://github.com/kkyz13/reactRank/assets/155720573/84ee5f8a-1d0d-41a6-b8cf-0922329060cf)
You can also click and drag from the _left_ search results to the **right** list area.

![going up_2](https://github.com/kkyz13/reactRank/assets/155720573/447dafb8-e0a4-4b3b-8049-8567be825d23)
Use the arrow controls inside the ranked entry to move it up and down.

![saving](https://github.com/kkyz13/reactRank/assets/155720573/cbb468c7-a22a-466d-81ae-8eb23af3656c)
Give your list a name _(this is required!)_ and hit save!

You can update it with the update button, and duplicate would create a duplicate list.

![delalist](https://github.com/kkyz13/reactRank/assets/155720573/58f7fc2c-f87d-4aac-8d0e-f3522613f2f0)
To delete a list, you need to go to the Control Panel page to delete. Deleting is not undoable.


## Next Steps
