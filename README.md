# reactRank 
 A Vite React App by Kenneth Koh
## For General Assembly SEI-49
Wanted to brag and share your favourite videogames? Wanted to present those favourite games in a really cool looking list?
Want a list you could look back and realized how much you changed/didn't change?

<sup>This was something I wanted to do for a long time, though now I understand why so few people made one (it's extremely hard!)</sup>

## Technologies
VITE React, CSS, Javascript

Pac-man Loader from [React-Spinners by David Hu](https://www.davidhu.io/react-spinners/)
## How to Use
![Sequence 01_1](https://github.com/kkyz13/reactRank/assets/155720573/a3a83c1f-3723-4d83-8884-d602751ad4ed)

After searching for your video game, you can click the "add to current list" button accompanying the search result to add it to your list.

![Sequence 01](https://github.com/kkyz13/reactRank/assets/155720573/84ee5f8a-1d0d-41a6-b8cf-0922329060cf)
You can also click and drag from the _left_ search results to the **right** list area.

![Sequence 01_2](https://github.com/kkyz13/reactRank/assets/155720573/be6e2676-ba02-4133-a134-9d08ad416bf5)
Use the arrow controls inside the ranked entry to move it up and down.

**Give your list a name _(this is required!)_ and hit save!** 

You can update it with the update button, and duplicate would create a duplicate list.

To delete a list, you need to go to the Control Panel page to delete. Deleting is not undoable.


## Next Steps
 - Proper sharing functionality
 - Screenshotting natively 
 - Better Drag and Drop
 - Better feedback to user of operations
 - Expand to more than just videogames, like movies.
